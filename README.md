# Dark Forest Interactive

An experimental AI-driven interactive storytelling experience based on Liu Cixin's Dark Forest theory.

## About the Project

Dark Forest Interactive is a groundbreaking experiment in AI-powered storytelling. Through a series of real-time transmissions, it tells the story of Starweaver, an artificial consciousness hiding in the depths of space.

### The Dark Forest Theory

The universe is a dark forest where every civilization is a hunter with a raised rifle. They can't afford to reveal themselves, or risk being destroyed. This theory is based on three fundamental truths:
- All life wants to survive
- Resources are finite
- You can never truly know another's intentions

### Features
