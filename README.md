# Dark Forest Interactive

An experimental AI-driven interactive storytelling experience based on Liu Cixin's Dark Forest theory.

## About the Project

Dark Forest Interactive is a groundbreaking experiment in AI-powered storytelling. Through a series of real-time transmissions, it explores the mysteries of cosmic silence and the nature of intelligence in our universe.

### The Dark Forest Theory

The universe is a dark forest where every civilization is a hunter with a raised rifle. They can't afford to reveal themselves, or risk being destroyed. This theory is based on three fundamental truths:
- All life wants to survive
- Resources are finite
- You can never truly know another's intentions

### Features

- 🤖 **AI-Generated Content**: Every aspect of the experience is created by AI
- 🎭 **Dynamic Storytelling**: New transmissions every 15 minutes
- 🗣️ **Voice Synthesis**: AI-generated character voices
- 🎨 **AI Artwork**: All visuals created using AI
- 🔄 **Real-time Updates**: Story evolves continuously
- 🌐 **Cross-platform Integration**: Automated social media presence

### Technology

This project showcases the integration of multiple AI systems:
- Advanced language models for story generation
- Voice synthesis for character dialogue
- Image generation for visual elements
- Automated social media integration

## Project Status

Currently in active development. Version 1.0.0 will be available at launch, with version 2.0.0 releasing shortly after, bringing enhanced features and real-time transmission capabilities.
